# Database - CURRENTLY DOWN

# Trace
This is the web-app portion of the open-source application Trace, an application for schools to track students in a seemless and non-intrusive way. This can be used to see when students arrive, leave for a drink/bathroom/store, and when they leave, all with times printed in a easy to view database. 

## Development
`cd Trace && npm run start`

## Production
`cd Trace && npm run build`

Then deploy the contents of the `build` folder to your web server.

One way to do this is to use Firebase Hosting. See the [React Deployment Documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment#firebase) for more information.
