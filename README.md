# Trace
This is the web-app portion of the open-source application Trace, an application for schools to track checkout times for class, like when someone goes to get a drink, or to a school store, just by scanning a QRCode!

## Development
`cd Trace && npm run start`

## Production
`cd Trace && npm run build`

Then deploy the contents of the `build` folder to your web server.

One way to do this is to use Firebase Hosting. See the [React Deployment Documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment#firebase) for more information.
